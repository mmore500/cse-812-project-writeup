\caption{
Resource sharing phenotypes between updates 0 and 20 for high mutational load, large resource wave treatments.
Bar height represents the mean amount of resource transferred per update per neighboring pair of cells.
Each two-tone pair of bars compares cell pairs with a particular relationship to cell pairs without that relationship.
The ``Same Channel'' bar pair compares resource sharing between cell pairs with a common channel and cell pairs on different channels.
The ``Cell Parent'' bar pair compares the amount of resource shared from a cell to its cellular parent to the amount of resource shared from a cell to cells that are not its cellular parent.
The ``Cell Child'' bar pair compares the amount of resource shared from a cell to its cellular child to the amount of resource shared from a cell to cells that are not its cellular child.
For the next two relationships, consider a cell with channel ID $A$ that reproduces, producing a daughter cell with the new channel ID $B$.
Let the channel ID $C$ denote a channel ID that is unique from channel IDs $A$ and $B$.
The ``Propagule Parent'' bar pair compares the amount of resource shared from a cell to cells with the channel ID that its channel ID descends from (e.g., from cells with channel ID $B$ to cells with channel ID $A$) to the amount of resource shared to other cells that are not part of its same-channel network (e.g., to cells with channel ID $C$).
The ``Propagule Child'' bar pair compares the amount of resource shared from a cell to cells with a channel ID that descends from its channel ID (e.g., from cells with channel ID $A$ to cells with channel ID $B$) to the amount of resource shared to other cells that are not part of its same-channel network (e.g., to cells with channel ID $C$).
Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals.
